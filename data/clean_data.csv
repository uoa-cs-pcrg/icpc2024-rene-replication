1. A meaningful name makes it easy to understand the code after the first reading of the name, thereby reducing access to ER when encountering it again, accelerating the efficiency of the assimilation process, and increasing comprehensibility.
2. With multiple abstraction layers, understanding the top level can reduce access to lower levels(ER), accelerate the efficiency of the assimilation process, and increase comprehensibility.
